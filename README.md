### Built with

- HTML

### What I learned

I have been learning HTML and CSS for a while now, and wished to test out my skills. Even though the project belongs to 'easy' or 'newbie' level, I had to struggle a little bit to get it to successfully complete it.

I mainly learnt how to use pseudo classes through this project.

```
.payment:hover{
    background-color: rgba(118,108,241,255);
}
```
I had not used pseudo classes in my projects before this.
